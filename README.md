Hi, I’m David and I’m looking to get started in a career in coding due to my passion for building and developing great projects.

I’m currently learning front-end web development and how to use GitHub in order to effectively collaborate, share code, gain feedback, and learn from other fellow coders.

You can reach me at: davidjuarez723@gmail.com
