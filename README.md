- 👋 Hi, I’m @davidjuarez723
- 👀 I’m interested in getting started in a career in programming and coding because I love building things and working behind the scenes in creating great content.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end web development and how to use GitHub to be able to collaborate, share code and gain feedback, and learn from other fellow coders.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that could use my insight and that can help grow and push to go outside of my comfort zone.
- 📫 How to reach me: davidjuarez723@gmail.com
